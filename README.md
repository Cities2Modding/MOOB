# MOOB - Map Optimization and Ongoing Bug-fixing

MOOB is a "polyfill" type mod designed to enhance the usability of the Map Editor in Cities Skylines 2. It addresses key issues and fills in functionality gaps, providing an improved experience for map creation and editing.

## Features

1. **Improved Heightmap Import:** Utilizes Windows OpenFileDialog for easier heightmap selection and import. (It was easier than using the games ImageAsset functionality)
2. **Heightmap Export to 16-bit RAW:** Enables exporting heightmaps in the 16-bit RAW format for greater precision and compatibility.
3. **Enabled Map Editor Option in Game:** Unlocks the map editor within Cities Skylines 2, allowing direct access for map creation and editing.
